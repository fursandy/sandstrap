		                    <p>Typographically, preformatted text is not the same thing as code. Sometimes, a faithful execution of the text requires preformatted text that may not have anything to do with code. For example:</p>
		                    <pre>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"</pre>
		                    <h4>Code</h4>
		                    <p>Code can be presented inline, like <code>&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_url'); ?&gt;</code>, or within a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> block. Because we have more specific typographic needs for code, we'll specify Consolas and Monaco ahead of the browser-defined monospace font.</p>

		                    <p>Let's keep it simple. Italics are good to help set it off from the body text. Be sure to style the citation.</p>
		                    <blockquote>
